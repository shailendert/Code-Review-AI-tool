# Code Review AI Tool

Welcome to the **Code Review AI Tool** repository!

This project is designed to help developers by automating code reviews using static analysis, AI, and machine learning. The goal is to create a tool that provides insights on code quality and follows coding standards across different programming languages such as Python, Java, and C#.

## Project Plan

This repository follows a structured project plan with multiple phases to ensure steady progress. You can find the detailed plan below, which outlines the different tasks and goals for each phase of the project.

### Key Phases:

1. **Phase 1: Python Code Review Tool (Initial Version)**
2. **Phase 2: Expand to Java and C# Support**
3. **Phase 3: AI and Machine Learning Integration**
4. **Phase 4: Open Source and Community Engagement**
5. **Phase 5: App/Plugin Integration (GitHub, Bitbucket, IDEs)**

For a detailed breakdown of each phase, including tasks and instructions, visit the [PROJECT_PLAN.md](docs/PROJECT_PLAN.md).
