## Folder Breakdown

### `.github/`
This directory contains GitHub-specific files:
- **`ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md`**: Template for submitting issues (e.g., bug reports, feature requests).
- **`PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`**: Template for submitting pull requests.
- **`workflows/`**: Contains GitHub Actions workflows for CI/CD, such as building, testing, and deploying the project.

### `docs/`
This folder holds all documentation files for the project:
- **`CODING_STANDARDS.md`**: Detailed coding standards and guidelines for contributors.
- **`CONTRIBUTING.md`**: Guidelines on how to contribute to the project.
- **`CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`**: Code of conduct to ensure a welcoming and inclusive community.
- **`README.md`**: High-level project overview, installation instructions, and usage examples.

### `src/`
This directory contains the main source code for the project, divided by programming language (Python, Java, and C#):
- **`python/`**: Code related to Python-based code review, including core logic and unit tests.
- **`java/`**: Code related to Java-based code review, including core logic and unit tests.
- **`csharp/`**: Code related to C#-based code review, including core logic and unit tests.

### `plugins/`
This folder contains the logic and integration code for various platforms:
- **`github/`**: Plugin for GitHub integration to run code reviews on GitHub repositories.
- **`bitbucket/`**: Plugin for Bitbucket integration to run code reviews on Bitbucket repositories.
- **`ide/`**: Plugin for integration with IDEs (e.g., Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ) to provide code review suggestions.

### `scripts/`
This folder contains utility scripts for setting up and running the project:
- **`setup.py`**: A script for setting up the environment and project dependencies.
- **`install_dependencies.py`**: A script to install project dependencies, if not handled automatically.
- **`run_tests.py`**: A script to run all tests across Python, Java, and C# code.

### `tests/`
This folder contains general project tests:
- **`test_integration.py`**: Tests for the overall project integration.
- **`test_performance.py`**: Performance-related tests.

### Root Directory Files:
- **`.gitignore`**: Specifies files and directories that should be ignored by Git (e.g., `node_modules/`, `*.pyc`).
- **`requirements.txt`**: A list of dependencies for Python, if you're working with Python-based code review.
- **`setup.py`**: Setup script for installing dependencies in Python.
- **`Dockerfile`**: Optional file for creating a Docker container for the project.
- **`README.md`**: This file that describes the folder structure for your project.

## Folder Structure Considerations

- **Modularity:** The project is structured to allow for easy addition of new languages or features, such as adding support for new programming languages or integrating with additional Git services.
- **Scalability:** As the project grows, you can add new files and folders under the respective sections (`src/`, `plugins/`, `tests/`).
- **Separation of Concerns:** By keeping code reviews for Python, Java, and C# separate in their respective directories, the project allows for a clean and organized approach as different codebases are managed.
- **Ease of Use for Contributors:** The structure encourages good development practices and enables contributors to easily navigate the repository.

This file will help maintain organization and consistency as the project grows.
