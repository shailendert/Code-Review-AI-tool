# **Code Review AI Tool: Project Plan**

## **Project Overview**

The **Code Review AI Tool** is designed to automatically review code in multiple programming languages (starting with Python, expanding to Java and C#), providing feedback on style guidelines, best practices, and potential issues. In the long run, it will leverage AI and machine learning techniques to detect code smells, anti-patterns, and areas for optimization. This project is intended to be open-sourced and scalable, allowing for community contributions and improvements.

## **Project Phases**

### **Phase 1: Python Code Review Tool (Initial Version)**

**Objective:** Build a code review tool that checks for common coding standards and style violations in Python code.

1. **Set Up the Project:**
   - **GitHub Repository**: Create a public repository under a permissive open-source license (e.g., MIT, Apache 2.0).
   - **Folder Structure**:
     ```
     /src             # Source code
     /tests           # Unit tests
     /docs            # Documentation
     requirements.txt # Dependencies
     README.md        # Project overview
     ```

2. **Code Parsing for Python**:
   - Use **`ast`** (Abstract Syntax Tree) or **`black`** for code formatting and checking for Python-specific style issues.
   - Use **`pyflakes`** or **`pylint`** to detect unused imports, undefined variables, or potential bugs.
   - Focus on PEP8 style guide (e.g., naming conventions, indentation, docstrings).

3. **Code Review Engine**:
   - Implement basic rules such as checking for indentation, variable naming, missing docstrings, etc.
   - Provide a human-readable report of the violations and suggestions for improvements.

4. **GitHub Action Integration**:
   - Set up a **GitHub Action** to trigger the tool on pull requests.
   - Provide comments on the pull request with code review feedback.

5. **Documentation**:
   - Include a detailed **README.md** file outlining how to set up, use, and contribute to the project.

### **Phase 2: Expand to Java and C#**

**Objective:** Scale the code review tool to support Java and C# by adding language-specific checks.

1. **Add Java Support**:
   - Use **Checkstyle** for Java to enforce style guidelines and check for issues like naming conventions, code length, and cyclomatic complexity.
   - Set up a Java-specific GitHub Action for running the code review tool.

2. **Add C# Support**:
   - Use **StyleCop** or **Roslyn analyzers** for C# to check code style, naming conventions, and complexity.
   - Set up a C#-specific GitHub Action for running the code review tool.

3. **Modular Architecture**:
   - Design the tool to be modular so that it can easily be extended to support more languages in the future.
   - Ensure code for each language is isolated and can be swapped out or extended without affecting the overall structure.

4. **Test Each Language**:
   - Write unit tests for Python, Java, and C# code checks to ensure the tool works as expected.
   - Create **mock repositories** for each language and test the tool on them.

### **Phase 3: AI and Machine Learning Integration**

**Objective:** Enhance the tool with AI capabilities to detect complex issues like code smells and anti-patterns.

1. **Dataset Collection**:
   - Collect public datasets of Python, Java, and C# code. Potential sources include **CodeSearchNet**, GitHub repositories, or open-source projects.
   - Label the data with types of violations or issues such as code smells (e.g., long functions, duplicate code) and anti-patterns.

2. **Machine Learning Model**:
   - Train a machine learning model (e.g., using **transformers** like **CodeBERT** or **Graph Neural Networks**) to classify code based on its quality.
   - Integrate the model to provide advanced suggestions for improving code quality.

3. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Evaluate the performance of the AI model based on precision, recall, and accuracy metrics.
   - Continuously fine-tune the model based on new data and user feedback.

4. **Integrate AI with Static Analysis**:
   - After performing basic static analysis, run the AI model to detect more complex issues like code smells or areas for refactoring.

### **Phase 4: Open Source and Community Engagement**

**Objective:** Open-source the project and scale it by inviting contributions from the community.

1. **Open-Source Licensing**:
   - Choose an appropriate open-source license. The **MIT License** and **Apache 2.0** are widely used and allow for both commercial and non-commercial use.
     - **MIT License**: Simple, permissive license that allows anyone to use, modify, and distribute the software.
     - **Apache 2.0**: More comprehensive, with explicit patent grants and contributions back to the project.
   - Add a **LICENSE** file to your repository with the chosen license.

2. **Creating a CONTRIBUTING.md File**:
   - Write a **`CONTRIBUTING.md`** file to outline how others can contribute to the project. Provide guidelines for submitting issues, opening pull requests, and following coding standards.
   - Encourage contributions like bug fixes, adding language support, improving documentation, and enhancing the AI features.

3. **Documentation for Users and Developers**:
   - **README.md**: Ensure the README is clear and complete, explaining how to install, configure, and use the tool. Include examples of how the tool works, its features, and potential use cases.
   - **Code Documentation**: Use inline comments and docstrings to explain the purpose and functionality of the code, making it easier for new contributors to understand and modify.
   - Provide examples of how to extend the tool to new programming languages or frameworks.

4. **Community Engagement**:
   - Create issues tagged as **"good first issue"** to make it easier for new contributors to get started with the project.
   - Respond promptly to issues and pull requests to maintain an active and welcoming community.
   - Consider adding a **Discord** or **Slack** channel for real-time discussions and support.

5. **Roadmap**:
   - Define a **roadmap** for future improvements and features (e.g., support for more languages, advanced AI features, integration with popular IDEs like VS Code or PyCharm).

### **Avoiding Copyright and Legal Issues**

1. **Licensing and Contributions**:
   - Use a **permissive open-source license** like **MIT** or **Apache 2.0** to ensure that others can freely use, modify, and distribute the project without legal concerns.
   - **Contributor License Agreement (CLA)**: As the project grows, consider adding a CLA to ensure that contributors agree to license their contributions back to the project under the same terms as the rest of the project.

2. **Using External Code**:
   - When incorporating external libraries (e.g., **PyGitHub**, **Checkstyle**, **black**, etc.), make sure they are open source and properly licensed (e.g., MIT, Apache 2.0).
   - Do not include proprietary or copyrighted code unless it is explicitly allowed under the license (e.g., some third-party libraries have specific clauses for commercial use).

3. **Avoiding Copyright Infringement**:
   - **Do not use proprietary code** or code from repositories that are not explicitly open-source.
   - If you plan to integrate code from others, ensure it is well-documented with a clear open-source license and that you comply with the terms (e.g., providing attribution if necessary).
   - If using AI models that were trained on proprietary datasets, ensure the model and dataset are compliant with open-source guidelines and do not violate copyright.

4. **Code Attribution**:
   - For any third-party code or libraries used, make sure to properly attribute the authors and include the licenses in the documentation (e.g., in `README.md` or a `NOTICE` file).
   - If someone contributes code to the repository, include an attribution in the code comments, and ensure they are listed in the `CONTRIBUTORS.md` file.
