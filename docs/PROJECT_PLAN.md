# Project Plan for Code Review AI Tool

## Overview

The **Code Review AI Tool** aims to automate code review using static analysis and AI, providing developers with real-time feedback about their code quality. This tool supports multiple languages like Python, Java, and C# and is designed to be integrated into popular version control systems (e.g., GitHub, Bitbucket) and IDEs (VS Code, JetBrains).

The project is divided into several phases, with each phase adding new features or expanding the toolâ€™s capabilities.

---

## **Phase 1: Python Code Review Tool (Initial Version)**

### Objective:
Build a Python code review tool that checks for common style and coding violations, using static analysis libraries such as `pyflakes`, `black`, and `pylint`.

### Tasks:
1. **Set up the Project Repository**
   - [ ] Create the GitHub repository with `README.md`, `LICENSE`, and basic structure.
   - [ ] Create a `requirements.txt` file with necessary dependencies.
   
2. **Implement Code Parsing and Static Analysis**
   - [ ] Use `black`, `pyflakes`, `pylint` to parse Python code and check for style violations.
   - [ ] Implement basic static analysis rules (e.g., indentation, unused imports).

3. **Create the Code Review Engine**
   - [ ] Design the review engine to generate human-readable feedback based on the analysis results.
   
4. **Write Unit Tests**
   - [ ] Write unit tests for various edge cases and typical code snippets.

5. **Set up GitHub Actions**
   - [ ] Create a GitHub Action to automatically trigger on pull request events.
   - [ ] Post feedback as comments on pull requests.

6. **Documentation**
   - [ ] Update `README.md` with setup instructions and examples.
   - [ ] Write a section on contributing and guidelines for PRs.

## **Phase 2: Expand to Java and C# Support**

### Objective:
Extend the code review tool to support Java and C# by leveraging popular analysis tools like **Checkstyle** (Java) and **StyleCop** (C#).

### Tasks:
1. **Java Support**
   - [ ] Integrate **Checkstyle** to analyze Java code for style violations.
   - [ ] Write Java-specific review logic and rules.

2. **C# Support**
   - [ ] Integrate **StyleCop** or **Roslyn Analyzers** for C# static analysis.
   - [ ] Implement C#-specific review rules.

3. **Modularize the Code**
   - [ ] Refactor the code to support multiple languages (Python, Java, C#).

4. **Set Up GitHub Actions for Multiple Languages**
   - [ ] Create a multi-language configuration for GitHub Actions.

5. **Documentation**
   - [ ] Update the `README.md` to reflect Java and C# support.
   - [ ] Add examples for Java and C# usage.

## **Phase 3: AI and Machine Learning Integration**

### Objective:
Incorporate AI to detect complex issues like code smells, anti-patterns, and optimization suggestions.

### Tasks:
1. **Collect and Label Datasets**
   - [ ] Gather open-source code datasets to train the AI model.
   - [ ] Label the data with common code issues.

2. **Train the Machine Learning Model**
   - [ ] Use pre-trained models (e.g., **CodeBERT**) or build your own to detect code smells.

3. **Integrate the AI Model into the Tool**
   - [ ] Incorporate AI feedback alongside static analysis results.

4. **Evaluate and Improve the Model**
   - [ ] Continuously evaluate and fine-tune the AI model.

5. **Documentation**
   - [ ] Explain AI integration in `README.md` with examples of AI-based suggestions.

## **Phase 4: Open Source and Community Engagement**

### Objective:
Open-source the project and invite contributions.

### Tasks:
1. **Choose an Open Source License**
   - [ ] Add a suitable open-source license (e.g., MIT License).

2. **Create Contributing Guidelines**
   - [ ] Write `CONTRIBUTING.md` with clear contribution instructions.
   - [ ] Create issue and PR templates.

3. **Create a Roadmap**
   - [ ] Define the roadmap for the next few phases and features.

4. **Engage with the Community**
   - [ ] Share the project on relevant forums, social media, and developer communities.

---

## **Phase 5: App/Plugin Integration (GitHub, Bitbucket, IDEs)**

### Objective:
Integrate the code review tool into GitHub, Bitbucket, and IDEs like VS Code and JetBrains.

### Tasks:
1. **GitHub App Setup**
   - [ ] Create a GitHub App that listens for pull request events and runs the review tool.
   
2. **Bitbucket Integration**
   - [ ] Set up a Bitbucket Pipeline to automatically trigger the review tool.

3. **VS Code Extension**
   - [ ] Build a VS Code extension that integrates the review tool into the editor.

4. **JetBrains Plugin**
   - [ ] Develop a plugin for JetBrains IDEs (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, PyCharm).

5. **Cloud API Setup (Optional)**
   - [ ] Build a cloud API for external integrations.

## **Ongoing Tasks**

- **Testing and Bug Fixes**
   - Regularly add new tests, handle bugs, and improve code performance.
   
- **Feature Improvements**
   - Work on adding new features as requested by contributors or the community.
