# **Expanding Code Review AI Tool: App/Plugin for Git Services and IDEs**

## **Project Overview**
The **Code Review AI Tool** will not only work as a standalone command-line tool or GitHub action but also be integrated into Git services (GitHub, Bitbucket) and IDEs (VS Code, JetBrains, etc.) as a plugin. This will enable seamless integration into developers' workflows, providing automatic code review feedback as they work on their repositories, without having to leave their development environment.

---

## **Phase 5: Making the Code Review Tool an Application or Plugin**

### **1. GitHub Integration (GitHub App/Action)**

**Objective:** Enhance the tool by creating a GitHub App or an integrated GitHub Action, allowing automated code reviews on pull requests or commits.

#### **Plan**:
1. **GitHub Action (Basic Setup)**:
   - Set up the **GitHub Action** to automatically trigger when a pull request is opened, updated, or when new code is pushed to a repository.
   - Configure the action to use the Code Review AI tool to perform static analysis and AI-based checks.
   - Provide detailed feedback through GitHub’s **checks API**, presenting the analysis as a **status check** or **inline comment**.

2. **GitHub App (Advanced Integration)**:
   - **GitHub App Setup**: Build a GitHub App that integrates with repositories, allowing users to authenticate via OAuth and give permission to access their repositories.
   - **Permissions**: Ensure the app has proper permissions to access pull requests, commit data, and write comments or status checks on those PRs.
   - **Webhook Integration**: Set up webhooks for events like `pull_request`, `push`, or `issue_comment`. The GitHub App will listen to these events and trigger the code review checks accordingly.
   - **Installation Flow**: Create an installation page for your GitHub App, allowing users to easily install the app in their repositories.

3. **Usage**:
   - After installing the GitHub App, users will be able to trigger code reviews on pull requests directly from GitHub.
   - Code review comments (e.g., "Missing docstring", "Naming convention error") will be posted directly on the PR, allowing developers to quickly address issues before merging.

#### **Tools and Resources**:
   - [GitHub Apps Documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/apps/building-github-apps)
   - [GitHub Actions Documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions)
   - GitHub's [Check Runs API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/checks)

---

### **2. Bitbucket Integration (Bitbucket Pipeline)**

**Objective:** Extend the tool to Bitbucket repositories, allowing code review automation within Bitbucket's CI/CD pipelines.

#### **Plan**:
1. **Bitbucket Pipeline Integration**:
   - **Bitbucket Pipelines** allows you to configure continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) for your repository. You can set up a pipeline to run the Code Review AI tool when new code is pushed or pull requests are made.
   - The pipeline will automatically trigger a code review using your tool on every commit or pull request and post feedback to the PR comments.

2. **Usage**:
   - Similar to GitHub Actions, you will provide a Bitbucket pipeline configuration file (`bitbucket-pipelines.yml`) that installs and runs the Code Review AI tool.
   - Feedback will be visible in the Bitbucket UI through pull request comments, helping developers adhere to code quality standards.

#### **Tools and Resources**:
   - [Bitbucket Pipeline Documentation](https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucket/bitbucket-pipelines-792496469.html)
   - [Bitbucket API for Pull Request Comments](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/bitbucket/rest/api-group-pullrequests/#api-pullrequests-comments-create)

---

### **3. IDE Integration (VS Code, JetBrains, etc.)**

**Objective:** Integrate the tool directly into IDEs to provide real-time feedback while developers write code.

#### **Plan**:
1. **VS Code Extension**:
   - **VS Code Extension**: Develop a VS Code extension that integrates the Code Review AI Tool. This extension would:
     - Allow developers to run a code review with a button click or automatically when they save their files.
     - Provide feedback in the **Problems** panel, showing warnings or errors related to code quality (e.g., coding standards, naming conventions, complexity issues).
     - Optionally, display AI-based suggestions or refactorings in the editor.

   - **Steps**:
     1. Set up the VS Code extension structure using **Node.js** and the [VS Code API](https://code.visualstudio.com/api).
     2. Implement a command to run the Python, Java, or C# review tool.
     3. Display results in a clean, interactive UI within the IDE.

   - **Usage**:
     - Developers will be able to install the extension and have the Code Review AI Tool run on their code directly from the IDE, getting instant feedback and suggestions.

2. **JetBrains Plugin (IntelliJ IDEA, PyCharm, WebStorm, etc.)**:
   - **JetBrains Plugin**: Develop a plugin for JetBrains IDEs to integrate the Code Review AI tool, providing inline feedback as developers work on their code.
   - The plugin will allow developers to run code reviews on files or whole projects and will present issues, suggestions, or refactoring opportunities directly within the editor.

   - **Steps**:
     1. Set up the plugin using the **JetBrains Plugin SDK**.
     2. Implement functionality to run the Code Review AI tool on the current file or project.
     3. Display results in the **Inspection** or **TODO** panel.
   
   - **Usage**:
     - Developers will be able to run real-time code reviews directly in their development environment and take immediate action on suggestions.

#### **Tools and Resources**:
   - [VS Code Extension API](https://code.visualstudio.com/api)
   - [JetBrains Plugin SDK](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/docs/intellij/welcome.html)
   - [VS Code Extension Documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/extensions/overview)
   - JetBrains Plugin Development Documentation

### **4. Making the Tool Cloud-Based (Optional)**

**Objective**: Provide a cloud-based version of the tool, accessible through a web interface or API for users who prefer not to configure the tool locally.

#### **Plan**:
1. **Cloud API**:
   - Expose the Code Review AI Tool as a **RESTful API** that accepts code (Python, Java, C#, etc.) and returns a JSON response with the code review results.
   - Users can send their code via an HTTP request, and the API will return detailed feedback on style violations, suggestions, and AI-based recommendations.

2. **Web Interface**:
   - Build a **web-based dashboard** where users can upload code and see results in real time.
   - Provide a user-friendly interface for non-technical users or those who don't want to install the tool locally.

3. **Usage**:
   - Users can integrate the API into their CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions, Bitbucket Pipelines) or directly access the tool via the web interface.

#### **Tools and Resources**:
   - Cloud platforms like **AWS**, **Google Cloud**, or **Azure** can host the API.
   - Use **Flask** or **FastAPI** to create the backend API for running the Code Review AI tool.
